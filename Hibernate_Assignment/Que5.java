        Q5 What are the benefits of using Hibernate Criteria API over regular SQL statements
        ->The advantages of the Criteria API is that it is intuitively designed to manipulate data without
         using any hard-coded SQL statements.
        ->Programmatic behavior offers compile-time syntax checking; as a result, most error messages are
         delivered during compilation
