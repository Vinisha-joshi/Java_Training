        Q6 Given an example of each of the following relationships
          1:1, 1:M, M: M, M:1 (one to one, one to many, many to many, many to one)

        Ans-->1) One-to-One Relationship: Such a relationship exists when each record of one table is related
        to only one record of the other table.
        For example, If there are two entities ‘Person’ (Id, Name, Age, Address)and
        ‘Passport’(Passport_id, Passport_no). So, each person can have only one passport and
        each passport belongs to only one person.

        2)One-to-Many or Many-to-One Relationship : Such a relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one or
        more than one record of the other table. This relationship is the most common relationship found.
        A one-to-many relationship can also be said as a many-to-one relationship depending upon the
        way we view it.
        For example, If there are two entity type ‘Customer’ and ‘Account’ then each ‘Customer’ can have
        more than one ‘Account’ but each ‘Account’ is held by only one ‘Customer’. In this example, we
        can say that each Customer is associated with many Account. So, it is a one-to-many relationship.
        But, if we see it the other way i.e many Account is associated with one Customer then we can say
        that it is a many-to-one relationship.

        3)Many-to-Many Relationship: Such a relationship exists when each record of the first table can
        be related to one or more than one record of the second table and a single record of the second
        table can be related to one or more than one record of the first table. A many-to-many relationship
        can be seen as a two one-to-many relationship which is linked by a 'linking table' or 'associate
        table'. The linking table links two tables by having fields which are the primary key of the other
        two tables. We can understand this with the following example.
        For Example: If there are two entity type ‘Customer’ and ‘Product’ then each customer can buy more
        than one product and a product can be bought by many different customers.
