Explain the benefits of DAO Pattern and provide an example.
->The advantage of using data access objects is the relatively simple and rigorous separation between
  two important parts of an application that can but should not know anything of each other, and which
  can be expected to evolve frequently and independently.
->If we need to change the underlying persistence mechanism we only have to change the DAO layer and not
  all the places in the domain logic where the DAO layer is used from.
