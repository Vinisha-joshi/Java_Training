In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one
object (an instance of the class) at a time. After the first time, if we try to
instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created.

Advantages of a Singleton pattern:

Singleton pattern can be implemented interfaces.
It can be also inherit from other classes.
It can be lazy loaded.
It has Static Initialization.
It can be extended into a factory pattern.
It help to It hide dependencies.
It provides a single point if access to a particular instance, so it is easy to maintain.
Disadvantages of a Singleton Pattern

Unit testing is more difficult (because it introduces a global state into an application).
